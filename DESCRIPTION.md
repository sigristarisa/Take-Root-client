# Take Root 
## The first online garden planner, combining the square-foot method and the companion method

### Backstory
It’s been buzzwords in the gardening world: the square-foot garden & companion planting. Effective and sufficient, I gave it a go to try these methods out as a gardening newbie, without realizing how simple methods could lead to a complex planning.
Can't plant tomatos next to corns, but compliments carrots, which can harm potatos...? Mint is overpowering so you can't plant multiple seedlings? What would happen if I plant parsley next to it?

That is: gardeners have knowledge, lists, memos and techniques, but not the practical tool to plan their perfect garden!

### What is "Square-Foot Method"?
**Square-foot gardening** (SFG) is a type of raised bed gardening — basically, a raised box divided into squares. With the square-foot gardening method, you plant in blocks instead of traditional rows. It’s a simple way to create easy-to-manage gardens with raised beds that need a minimum of time spent maintaining them. SFG advocates claim it produces more, uses less soil and water, and takes much less time to maintain than a traditional garden.
